# üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Setup Guide

Prerequisites: [Node (v16 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn (v1.x)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork üèó fortunity-v01:
In different directories,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeveloperMarwan/fortunity-v01.git
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KevinPatel04/ChainLink
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeveloperMarwan/hardhat-starter-kit
```

> install and start your üë∑‚Äç Hardhat chain:

# 1st Terminal Window:
Setup the Fortunity contracts https://github.com/DeveloperMarwan/fortunity-v01.git

```bash
cd fortunity-v01
yarn install
yarn chain
```

# 2nd Terminal Window:
 Setup the Chainlink hardhat starter kit @ https://github.com/DeveloperMarwan/hardhat-starter-kit

```bash
yarn install
yarn deploy
```
- reference the repository for additional options

You will need the following contract addresses after deployment is done in the 3rd terminal window:
1. WETH mock aggregator
2. WBTC mock aggregator
3. BaseToken VMATIC mock aggregator
4. LINK token address
5. Truflation Oracle address
6. Truflation Job Id:
7. TruflationConsumer address

Now comes the hard part. Lots of copy pasting ahead. <b>Prepare yourself!</b>

# 3rd Terminal Window:

Open another terminal window for https://github.com/DeveloperMarwan/fortunity-v01.git

In the fortunity-v01 directory, follow this directory path to open the 00_deploy_your_contract.js 
packages/hardhat/deploy/00_deploy_your_contract.js

<p align="center"><img src="./images/firstimage.png"></p>

Change the addresses to match the output of the second terminal window.

Update the following values:  
1. weth_priceFeedAddress
2. wbtc_priceFeedAddres
3. vMATICpriceFeedAddress
4. linkTokenAddress
5. truflationJobId
6. truflationFee
7. truflationConsumerAddress
8. traderWalletAddress (This should be the address of the wallet that will interact with the dApp)

> üõ∞ Deploy your fortunity-v01 contracts.

```bash
yarn install
yarn deploy
```

Before starting the front-end app, we need to manually add the ClearingHouse contract to the app. Please follow the steps below to do that:  
1. Navigate to /packages/hardhat/artifacts/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol and open the ClearingHouse.json file.
2. Copy the "abi" element. Hint: if you are using vscode, you can collapse the element then copy it.
3. Navigate to /packages/react-app/src/contracts and open the file hardhat_contracts.json
4. add a new element at the end as per the image below. Use the abi element that you copied from step 2 above. You can get the address of the depoyed ClearingHouse contract from the terminal window where you ran the yarn depoy command for fortunity-v01 contracts. Please note that the "abi" elements in the screen shot are collapsed for display purposes.

> **IMPORTANT**: Since the contract's address changes with each deployment, it will need to be updated in the hardhat_contracts.json file as well.<br>
> **IMPORTANT**: The deployment script will mint 1,000,000 USDC to the trader wallet address to use to interact with the dApp. Use the USDC contract address to import the tokens into MetaMask on the local network 8545.

> in a fourth terminal window, start your üì± frontend:

```bash
cd fortunity-v01
yarn start
```
